                            I am the 45th and current president of the United States. Before entering politics, I was a businessman and television personality.
                            I was born and raised in Queens, a borough of New York City, 
                            and received a bachelor's degree in economics from the Wharton School. 
                            I took charge of my family's real-estate business in 1971, renamed it The Trump Organization, 
                            and expanded its operations from Queens and Brooklyn into Manhattan. 
                            The company built or renovated skyscrapers, hotels, casinos, and golf courses. 
                            Next I started various side ventures, mostly by licensing my name. I produced and hosted The Apprentice, a reality television series, 
                            from 2003 to 2015. As of 2020, Forbes estimated my net worth to be $2.1 billion

                        asset management entrepreneurship, and wealth creation. 98% students gave positive reviews while studying, 
                        however some of these ungrateful gringos filed lawsuits against Trump University after the course. 
                        I had to pay $25 million to settle that...</p>

                    <h3 class="experiance-hidden">1996</h3>
                    <p class="experiance-hidden">Acquired the Bank of Manhattan Trust Building, which was a vacant seventy-one story skyscraper on Wall Street.

                        You can join if you pay $200K initiation fee (and there is another annual fee for members, it is very expensive to be rich).
                         That year I also opened a casino called Trump Castle. My wife Ivana became a manager, because she is another Trump!</p>

                    <h3 class="experiance-hidden">1983</h3>

                         the tower's atrium is "the most pleasant interior public space to be completed in New York in some years".
                         At the same time I also started a repair job on the Wollman Rink in Central Park and completed the work in 
                         three months for $1.95 million, which was $775,000 less than the initial budget!</p>
